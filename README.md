# Library-Management-System
 This system completely automates all your libraryâ€™s activities.The best way to maintain, organize, and handle countless books systematically is to implement a library management system software.  You can find books in an instant, issue/reissue books quickly, and manage all the data efficiently and orderly using this system. The purpose of a library management system is to provide instant and accurate data regarding any type of book, thereby saving a lot of time and effort.
This was my college final year project made completely with visual basic.
This project is free to use.
